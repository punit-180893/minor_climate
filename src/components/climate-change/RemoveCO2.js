            <p>If you've completed the above three steps, you've already made amazing progress. Unfortunately there are still many things in your life that produce greenhouse gas emissions -- from the manufacture of the clothes you wear to the dinner you ate last night. We'll try to  eliminate each of those problems later.</p>
            <p>For now, you can take another great step forward by paying Climeworks $7 to remove carbon from the atmosphere.</p>
            <p>
              If everyone in the world signed up online to become a Climeworks
              Explorer, we'd remove{" "}
              <strong> 
                663 billion kilograms of carbon from the atmosphere every year. 
              </strong>
               {" "}That sounds like a lot but it's actually only 1.3% of the 51 trillion kilograms we collectively emmit per year. It's a small step, but it could be very important.
            </p>
            <p>The more people invest in carbon extraction technologies, the more efficient they'll become. And we need them to be more efficient. So making this tiny investment of Â£6 per month is a big step in the right direction -- providing we can get enough people to do it. That's where the next steps come in.</p>
